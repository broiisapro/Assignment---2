If you are wondering, I had to watch a youtube tutorial on how to create a text file on macos
I ended up using Vim
I then remembered that I was using an IDE and could have made a text file through there
I then quit
If you are wondering about the build folder,
I used vim to write the project.
Thank you for not reading this with your full attention.
Did you catch the spelling issues?
Made you look
